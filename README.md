# Dollar General Self-Checkout - Web Implementation

This attempts to re-create the Dollar General Self-Checkout process in the browser as faithfully as possible.

See an example of it operating here: [https://youtu.be/cEKCKyMV7sY](https://youtu.be/cEKCKyMV7sY)

## Why?
My autistic son _loves_ the self-checkout at Dollar General and quotes it regularly. This was made to give him a way to hear his favorite audio prompts and re-play the process as much as he needed.

## Limitations
1. Audio quality is rough - ripped from my phone recording and other youtube videos. This needs to be improved.
2. Not all screens work as they do in real life - I haven't used them all before so some of the buttons just beep and do nothing.
